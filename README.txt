====================================
           Masaya (v0.1.0)
====================================

Masaya is a twin stick shooter adventure where you play loosely as a fisherman
who is shipwrecked on a mysterious island.  There, he encounters a demon who 
offers to aid him; who is he and why is he helping?

------------------------------------
 HOW TO PLAY
------------------------------------
- Left Stick  : Move
- Right Stick : Aim / Fire
- Start/Option: Card Management
- Alt+F4      : Quit (system menu not yet implemented)
- Alt+Enter   : Toggle Fullscreen

Collect **Cards** and **Mana** to power up your character.
- Equip a card by placing a gem on it.
- To level up: collect duplicates of the same card, then spend Mana.

Dying costs you half your Mana, but reaching checkpoints reduces how far
you need to travel to try again.
